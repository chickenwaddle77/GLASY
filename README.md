# GLASY
## Overview
GLASY is at its core an itinerary planner application, where we help plan the perfect route for someone’s outing by connecting different events and stores/restaurants into a walking path within a certain radius of their starting position. 

## Software Specification: 

The user will choose a location and select a radius, and the program returns a list of the most popular spots around. Based on this list, the program will plan an itinerary for the user’s day around visiting these spots, and will include times and routes to take. The program will plan the route based on whichever path is the most efficient (meaning which paths require the least amount of travel or are conveniently close to each other). To expand the program, the machine can also show the hours of operation for each location and take that into consideration, as well as the genre of the attraction. Another potential expansion is allowing the user to choose how many or specifically which locations they want to go to.
